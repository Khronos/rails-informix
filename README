Rails/Informix
---------------
ActiveRecord adapter to bring O/RM to IBM Informix Dynamic Server.

For installation instructions please read INSTALL. Current information can be
found at http://rails-informix.rubyforge.org

1. Rails configuration
2. Informix configuration
3. Caveats


1. Rails configuration

  The adapter has three options: database, user and password. Only database is
  mandatory. A sample database.yml file would look like this:

  development:
    adapter: informix
    database: stores

  If no user and password are specified, the user running the web server is
  used.


2. Informix configuration

  * You must have a sequence for each table in the form #{tablename}_seq.

    Example:

      create table customers(id serial, name varchar(40));
      create sequence customers_seq;

  * BYTE/TEXT columns must be NULLable.


3. Caveats

  * Prefer Informix 10 over Informix 9. Rails/Informix makes use of the SKIP
    option for pagination, which is only available since Informix 10.
