Rails/Informix installation
----------------------------

1. Requirements

	* Ruby/Informix 0.2.0 or above


2. Installation instructions

  Copy the file informix_adapter.rb into the directory:

  $RUBYLIB/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-*/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/

  where RUBYLIB is probably /usr/local/lib/ruby in Unix, and C:\ruby\lib\ruby
  in Windows.

  Then edit the file:

  $RUBYLIB/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-*/lib/active_record.rb

  to add "informix" to RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS:

  RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS = %w( mysql postgresql sqlite firebird sqlserver db2 oracle sybase openbase informix)


3. Rails configuration

  The adapter has three options: database, user and password. Only database is
  mandatory. A sample database.yml file would look like this:

  development:
    adapter: informix
    database: stores

  If no user and password are specified, the user running the web server is
  used.
